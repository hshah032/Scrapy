# Scrapy

## Overview

A web scraper built using Scrapy, a free open-source web crawling framework written in Python.

## Purpose

A prevalent problem faced by society today is that of fake news. This issue can be combatted using a machine learning based tool that classifies articles or parts of articles as being untrue. However, in order to use machine learning, one needs a lot of data. By building a robust web scraper, I hope to be able to gather the necessary data to develop a dataset for a fake news detector tool. 

## Requirements

* Python 3.5+
* Scrapy 

To install Scrapy, run the following command::

    pip install scrapy

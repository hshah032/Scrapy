Scrapy
======

Overview
=======

A web scraper built using Scrapy, a free open-source web crawling framework written in Python.

Purpose
=======

A prevalent problem faced by society today is that of fake news. This issue can be combatted using a machine learning based tool that classifies articles or parts of articles as being untrue. However, in order to use machine learning, one needs a lot of data. By building a robust web scraper, I hope to be able to gather the necessary data to develop a dataset for a fake news detector tool. 

Requirements
=======

* Python 3.5+
* Scrapy 
  
Install
=======

The quick way::

    pip install scrapy

See the install section in the documentation at
https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html for more details.

Problems
========

overcome four distinct threat defense mechanisms::

* User agent filtering
* Obfuscated javascript redirects
* Captchas
* Header consistency checks
